  "description": "This is my attempt at doing the exercises from Daniel Shiffmanâ€™s excellent book: [The Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com) in [p5.js](https://p5js.org) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org). Reading it and working through the exercises seems like a great way to learn about how to use algorithms inspired by natural phenonema to create interactive visual software.",
