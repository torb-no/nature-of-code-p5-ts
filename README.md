# Nature of Code p5.js/TypeScript

This is my attempt at doing the exercises from Daniel Shiffman’s excellent book: [The Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com) in [p5.js](https://p5js.org) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org). Reading it and working through the exercises seems like a great way to learn about how to use algorithms inspired by natural phenonema to create interactive visual software.

The entire book can [read online for free](http://natureofcode.com/book/) or you can [buy a PDF of the book with a price of your own choosing](http://natureofcode.com). Daniel Shiffman also has a [series of videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vX8wT1G798&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6YVljJvFRCyRM6mmF5wMPeE&index=1) on his YouTube which follows the book if you prefer that.

If you do plan on doing the exercies I recommend you *not* look at my exercises as they are much more fun to do if you come up with answers to them on your own. They can be useful as to look at how to set up p5 with TypeScript.

Why p5.js and TypeScript? I use TypeScript here because it provides excellent tooling (autocompletion, refactoring, etc…). The book uses Processing which is very similar to p5.js, which is a web-based spiritual successor to Processing.

My setup is inspired by [p5-typescript-starter](https://github.com/Gaweph/p5-typescript-starter). In particular, my TypeScript definitions are taken from that repo. I am not sure where those definitions created by [Gaweh](https://github.com/Gaweph) or if they are generated by [p5-types/p5.ts](https://github.com/p5-types/p5.ts)
