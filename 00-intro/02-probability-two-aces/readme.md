# Intro - Exercise I.2

> What is the probability of drawing two aces in a row from a deck of fity-two cards.

chance of drawing one ace = number of aces / number of cards = 4 / 52 = 0.077

chances of drawing two aces in a row = chances of drawing one ace * chances of drawing one ace = 0.077 * 0.077 = 0.005929
